# Summary

** Update 9/25/17 **

I just added two versions that should work for the S4 and S5 as well, one 23mm in diameter, the other 35mm - please let me know!

*******
I don't know of too many people who like to level their beds unless they have to, so why don't the leveling knobs have locknuts to help keep them from backing off as the plate bounces back and forth?

Inspired by Valstrath's "CR-10 Ultimate Leveling Knob Attachment" (https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2408748), I created a wheel that does away with the OEM inserts entirely, and uses an M4 nylon lock nut - ensuring that the wheel does not move once you have adjusted it into place.  Hopefully this will help tame the CR10 (or any other bed that uses M3 screws)

Notes: 
Requires a total of 8 M4 nylon locknuts.  Remove the stock leveling wheels, and use one of the locknuts to keep the screw in place on the hot bed (being the nut all the way to the top,. making the screw stay in place without the need to hold the top with a screwdriver).  Then replace the springs.  Insert the remaining M4 locknuts into the wheels and thread them on - wala!
