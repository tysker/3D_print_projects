# Summary

I designed this tool to allow easy levelling of the CR-10(s) X-axis gantry.

Over time, the gantry can tilt due to the stepper motors going out of sync. Simply place under the gantry on either side of the printer, undo the grub screws on the motor couplers and lower the gantry by hand onto the tools. Rotate the leadscrews to settle them and re-tighten the grub screws. Raise the gantry and remove the tools.

DO NOT FORGET TO REMOVE THE TOOLS - THIS WILL PREVENT THE GANTRY LOWERING.

If you print this design, please record the make and post a quick photo - let me know how you got on!

Cheers,

Rich

Uploaded V3 which has grooves on the underside to allow the tool to be used with plastic trim fitted to the extrusions.
