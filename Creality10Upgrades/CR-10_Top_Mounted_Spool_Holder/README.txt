# Summary

Just a quick spool holder I modeled in Fusion 360 so I could mount my filament spools to the top of my CR-10s. This should work well for any printer that uses 2020 aluminium extrusion. 

Other spool holders I have seen on thingiverse require some hardware to mount to the frame or to make up the holder itself. I prefer 100% printed solutions so I made this.

It's designed so the stock CR-10 spool spindle and nuts can be used but I'm also modeling a printable replacement version to make this a complete solution. 

Edit: 21/01/2018 added spool and nut for those who don't want to use the stock CR-10 parts

# Print Settings

Printer: CR-10s
Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.2mm
Infill: 20%

Notes: 
I printed this out of PETG for increased durability and used a raft to avoid any curling on such a thin part. It's a very simple print but due to it's size it can take ~6 hours.

Material: PETG
Temps: 250/70
Fan: 60%
Raft: Yes
Speed: 60mm/Sec

# Post-Printing

To install you will need to remove the two bolts which secure the top crossbeam to the upright. Once the bolts are removed the spool holder will slide into the extrusion. The bolts can then be replaced.
