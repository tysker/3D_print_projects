# Summary

This is a remix of the well known belt tensioner from fooyabt that was accommodated to fit the X and Y axis for the new ENDER 3. 

The X puller housing was modified to fit around the right gantry carrier, it is a 10mm carrier but it uses the 15mm puller.

The Y housing was left untouched from the designed made by irritatingsour since it fits perfectly fine on the ENDER 3 and i am including it here as a bundle so you can get all you need in one place.

The only other thing modified were scale sizes to correct tolerances so you dont have to mess around with and can print all of the parts as they are for a perfect fit (assuming that you printer can produce decent accuracy)

you will need 2 - 5x25 mm bolt and nut (I used socket head)
