# Summary

This should fix a common problem people have with the Ender3 where the PTFE tube pops off. it clips around the pressure fitting to hold it tight. 

There are 3 different sizes for each side. 1mm 1,5mm 2mm this is because I don't expect them to all be the same you don't need to force it. You just want to stop the fitting from being able to depress.

# Print Settings

Rafts: Doesn't Matter
Supports: No
Resolution: 0.1mm
Infill: 20

Notes: 
Slow print speed is probably better for this 20mm/s works fine.
