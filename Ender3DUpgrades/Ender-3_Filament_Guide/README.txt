# Summary

Hello Everyone,

I just bought an Ender-3 3D printer and I see that the threaded screw rod is very close to the filament input port of the extruder drive feed. Very Close in fact it is so close it touches the rod and picks up grease from time to time. So I made this Filament guide with a guard for the screw rod. I saw one here online for the Ender-2 and kind of based it off of it. This one might also fit the Ender-2 as well. Not sure because I do not have one to test with. So Share and Enjoy everyone. Grab it if you can use it. Printed it in yellow so that it will stand out in the picture. I am reprinting it now in black for my use.

Update: Well it was about 3 AM this morning when I finished this and after some sleep I took a look at it and I did not like the over hang. So I made a three versions. The last one is in case you do not like the coffee cup look. I left the first version up because I am going to put it on my CR-10 S500. Pick you favorite. One final note do not over tighten the 2 screws it will bind the rod. Make sure you can move the rod freely. I adjusted the square version and made the holes a little larger in case that will help in the fit. I have tried all versions on my printer and they fit well. Not sure if the older version of the Ender-3 has a different T8 nut.

I added a slotted version because two people was telling me that it did not fit. But from what I can gather they have the older version of the Ender-3. If you are having issues try the other versions or let me know. Thanks.

Update: The Older Ender-3 version is just a little different and does not fit. I have added a version 4 to fit the older unit. I ordered a second Ender-3 and got one of the older model and I have printed and tested the fit. So please use the version that fits your model.
I just added a universal version that will fit both types.
