# Summary

**EDIT 10-12-2018:** <em>To be clear, you will need **two 608ZZ bearings**.</em>

**EDIT 4-12-2018:** <em>As I found it difficult to print the roller in one piece without breaking the small pins on the outsides, I remixed [Keleo's design](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3222112) "Roller with removable pin." to a 80mm spool version and printed that. I've included these files in the thing files section as of now.</em>

I really liked the original [Filler](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3020026), however the slide-in mechanism to attach the Filament Holder to my Creality Ender 3 was fairly wide. Also, my spool was quite far away from the metal Creality part on top of the extrusion. These two issues resulted in the spool leaning downwards and almost sliding off. Therefore I merged the two different parts together and made the whole shorter to better fit the 80mm width spools I use. 

Post your makes! :)
